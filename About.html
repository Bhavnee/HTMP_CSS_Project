            <div class="row">
                <p class="flex"> Corporation[a] is a Japanese multinational video game and entertainment company headquartered in Shinagawa
                Tokyo. Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are headquartered in Irvine, California, and London.
                Its division for the development of both arcade games and home video games, Sega Games, has existed in its current state
                since 2020; from 2015 to that point, the two had made up separate entities known as Sega Games and Sega Interactive Co.,
                Ltd. Sega is a subsidiary of Sega Group Corporation, a part of Sega Sammy Holdings. From 1983 until 2001, Sega also
                developed video game consoles. <img src="g1.png" height="400px" width="400px" id="g1"></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
            <p class="flex">Sega was founded by American businessmen Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as Nihon Goraku Bussan[b] on June 3, 1960; shortly
                 after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Five years later, the company became known,
                  as Sega Enterprises, Ltd., after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of coin-operated games. Sega developed its first 
                  coin-operated game, Periscope, in 1966.<img src="1.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" id="g2"></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  
            <p class="flex">Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries in 1969. Following a downturn in the 
                  arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the SG-1000 and Master System but
                   struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1984, Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama 
                   led a management buyout with backing from CSK Corporation.<img src="2.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" id="g3">

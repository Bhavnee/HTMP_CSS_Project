            <p  class="flex"> Game Gear[a] is an 8-bit fourth generation handheld game console released by<br> Sega on October 6, 1990, in Japan, in
             April 1991 throughout North America and Europe,<br> and during 1992 in Australia. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's
             Game<br> Boy, the Atari Lynx, and NEC's TurboExpress. It shares much of its hardware with the<br> Master System, and can play Master 
             System games by the use of an adapter. Sega<br> positioned the Game Gear, which had a full-color backlit screen with a landscape<br> 
             format, as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy.<br> <img src="ab1.jpg.crdownload" height="400px" width="450px" class="abtimg" id="ab"></p><br><br>

            <p  class="flexleft"><img src="ga1.jpg" height="420px" width="470px" id="img2" > The Game Gear was rushed to market, its unique game library
                 and price<br> point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress. However, due to<br> its short battery life,
                 lack of original games, and weak support from Sega, the<br> Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy, selling 10.62
                 million<br> units by March 1996. The Game Gear was discontinued on April 30,<br> 1997. It was re-released as a budget system by Majesco<br>
                  Entertainment in 2000, under license from Sega.</p><br><br>

            <p class="flex2">Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with praise for its<br> full-color backlit screen and processing 
                power for its time,<br> criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and questions<br> over the quality of
                 its game library. The Game Gear Micro, a<br> retroconsole, was announced in June 2020 and released in<br> October of the 
                 same year.<br> <img src="a.webp" height="400px" width="450px" class="abtimg" id="a"></p>
